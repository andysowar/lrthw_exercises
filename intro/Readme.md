###What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know?
>######1. Reading & Writing.

>######2. Attention to Detail.

>######3. Spotting Differences. 

###Please explain these three skills in your own words.

>1. If you can't read, you are just in trouble in life. You need to be able to read books & documentation to learn
how to code. Writing is also very important. If you type with just two fingers and have to stare at the keyboard, you 
will get very frustrated very fast. Typing well makes you a better & more efficient coder. <p>

>2. Attention to detail is so important in coding! The smallest mistake such as adding an extra character to your code 
will break it. This is especially important when fixing bugs. Pay attention!<p>

>3. Spotting differences fits right under attention to detail. This is even more important when fixing bugs in your
code. Also, when learning from someone else's example it is really important to be able to make sure
you are typing in the same things. If not you need to be able to see the difference.<p>

###Why do you need to not copy and paste?

>Learning to code is much like learning how to play an instrument. You need to train you hands, eyes, & brain to 
perform the same tasks again & again. The only way to do this is by typing in everything manually & memorizing the 
syntax. You can't do this with copy & paste.

######Why is Practice and Persistence important?

>Just like anything that requires skill, practice is important. It's the only way to get better. You need 
to make mistakes & then learn from them. I've heard it takes 10,000 hours of practice to master any skill.
Without persistence you will never be able to practice enough to get good. Everyone will suck & struggle at first, but 
by keeping at it you can truly do great things.
